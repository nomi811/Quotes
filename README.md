* Why do I succeed?

  I succeed because I am willing to do the things you are not.  I will fight against the odds.  I will sacrifice.  I am not shackled by fear, insecurity, or doubt. I feel those emotions, drink them in and then swallow them away to the blackness of hell.  I am motivated by accomplishment, not pride.  Pride consumes the weak - kills their heart from within.  If I fail, I will get up.  If I am beaten, I will return.  I will never stop getting better.  I will never give up, ever.

  That is why I succeed.  - Anonymous

* You've got to find what you love.  And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.  Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.  And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.  If you haven't found it yet, keep looking.  Don't settle.  As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.

  And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.  So keep looking until you find it.  Don't settle ... Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.  Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking.  Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.

  Most importantly, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.  They somehow already know what you truly want to become.  Everything else is secondary.  - Steve Jobs

* Clarity comes from engagement, not thought.  - Marie Forleo

* Take action in one direction or another and feel your way.

* Choose one thing to be an expert on.  Focus on one thing, but that doesn't mean you have to give up the rest. Just don't try to do it all at the same time.
